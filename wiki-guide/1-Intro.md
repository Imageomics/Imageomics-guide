# Welcome to the Imageomics Institute!

This wiki is intended to host internal documentation, making the information needed to get started with and use institute resources readily available to all members. It will evolve continuously with the institute.

## Highlights
There are many pages of useful information contained in this wiki covering a range of topics from institute hardware, to repositories and archives, to a glossary of _imageomics-related_ terms.

### Just starting a project?
Check out our guides to get your project off on the right foot!
- [The GitHub Repo Guide](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/wiki/3.1.-GitHub-Repo-Guide): This page reviews expected and suggested GitHub repository contents, as well as structural considerations. 
- [The Hugging Face Repo Guide](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/wiki/3.2.-Hugging-Face-Repo-Guide): Analogous expected and suggested repository contents for Hugging Face repositories; there are notable differences from GitHub in both content and structure.
- [Metadata Guide](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/wiki/Metadata-Guide): Guide to metadata collection and documentation. Follows closely the [HF Dataset Card Template](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/blob/main/templates/HF_DatasetCard_Template_Imageomics.md?plain=1) sections.

### Project repo up, what's next?
Check out our workflow guides for how to interact with your new repo:
- [The GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/wiki/2.1.-The-GitHub-Workflow): This page mainly focuses on branching and the PR process.
- [The Hugging Face Workflow](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/wiki/2.2.-The-Hugging-Face-Workflow): Analogous workflow directions for Hugging Face; there are notable differences from GitHub in how this process works practically, though the concept is the same.

### Project management or organization got you down?
Discover new tools to help:
- [Guide to GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/wiki/4.1.-Guide-to-GitHub-Projects): This page focuses on GitHub's project management tool, Projects, which integrates issues and pull requests into a unified task board to keep tabs on how your project is progressing. Labels, milestones, and assignee tags provide improved organization, and allow for more focused views.
- [Helpful Tools for your Workflow](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/wiki/Helpful-Tools-for-your-Workflow): Collection of useful tools to facilitate and improve workflows. Comments and recommendations encouraged!
- [Virtual Environments](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/wiki/Virtual-Environments): Summary of `conda` and `pip` environments: how to make, use, and share them.

### Other pages of note:
- [Glossary for Imageomics](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/wiki/Glossary-for-Imageomics): Collection of terms used in imageomics. The goal is to ensure all participating domains are represented, thus facilitating interdisciplinary communication. This is a group effort, please check it out and add terms you think should be there!
- [Command Line Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/Imageomics/internal-guidelines/wiki/Command-Line-Cheat-Sheet): Collection of useful bash, emacs, and git commands.

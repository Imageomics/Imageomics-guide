They are 1024 x 1024, and the color has been standardized using &lt;link to color standardization package&gt;.\n--&gt;\n\n### Data Fields\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!--\nDescribe the types of the data files or the columns in a CSV with metadata.\n\nEx: \n**metadata.csv**:\n  - `img_id`: Unique identifier for the dataset. \n  - `specimen_id`: ID of specimen in the image, provided by museum data source. There are multiple images of a single specimen.\n  - `species`: Species of the specimen in the image. There are N different species of &lt;genus&gt; of &lt;animal&gt;.\n  - `view`: View of the specimen in the image (e.g., `ventral` or `dorsal` OR `top` or `bottom`, etc.; specify options where reasonable).\n  - `file_name`: Relative path to image from the root of the directory (`&lt;species&gt;/&lt;img_id&gt;.png`); allows for image to be displayed in the dataset viewer alongside its associated metadata.\n--&gt;\n\n### Data Splits\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!--\nGive your train-test splits for benchmarking; could be as simple as \"split is indicated by the `split` column in the metadata file: `train`, `val`, or `test`.\" Or perhaps this is just the training dataset and other datasets were used for testing (you may indicate which were used).\n--&gt;\n\n## Dataset Creation\n\n### Curation Rationale\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!-- Motivation for the creation of this dataset. For instance, what you intended to study and why that required curation of a new dataset (or if it's newly collected data and why the data was collected (intended use)), etc. --&gt;\n\n### Source Data\n\n&lt;!-- This section describes the source data (e.g., news text and headlines, social media posts, translated sentences, ...). As well as an original source it was created from (e.g., sampling from Zenodo records, compiling images from different aggregators, etc.) --&gt;\n\n#### Data Collection and Processing\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!-- This section describes the data collection and processing process such as data selection criteria, filtering and normalization methods, re-sizing of images, tools and libraries used, etc. \nThis is what _you_ did to it following collection from the original source; it will be overall processing if you collected the data initially.\n--&gt;\n\n#### Who are the source data producers?\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!-- This section describes the people or systems who originally created the data.\n\nEx: This dataset is a collection of images taken of the butterfly collection housed at the Ohio State University Museum of Biological Diversity. The associated labels and metadata are the information provided with the collection from biologists that study butterflies and supplied the specimens to the museum.\n --&gt;\n\n\n### Annotations\n&lt;!-- \nIf the dataset contains annotations which are not part of the initial data collection, use this section to describe them. \n\nEx: We standardized the taxonomic labels provided by the various data sources to conform to a uniform 7-rank Linnean structure. (Then, under annotation process, describe how this was done: Our sources used different names for the same kingdom (both _Animalia_ and _Metazoa_), so we chose one for all (_Animalia_). --&gt;\n\n#### Annotation process\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!-- This section describes the annotation process such as annotation tools used, the amount of data annotated, annotation guidelines provided to the annotators, interannotator statistics, annotation validation, etc. --&gt;\n\n#### Who are the annotators?\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!-- This section describes the people or systems who created the annotations. --&gt;\n\n### Personal and Sensitive Information\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!-- \nFor instance, if your data includes people or endangered species. --&gt;\n\n\n## Considerations for Using the Data\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!--\nThings to consider while working with the dataset. For instance, maybe there are hybrids and they are labeled in the `hybrid_stat` column, so to get a subset without hybrids, subset to all instances in the metadata file such that `hybrid_stat` is _not_ \"hybrid\".\n--&gt;\n\n### Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. Could also address misuse, malicious use, and uses that the dataset will not work well for.--&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- For instance, if your data exhibits a long-tailed distribution (and why). --&gt;\n\n### Recommendations\n[More Information Needed]\n&lt;!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. --&gt;\n\n## Licensing Information\n[More Information Needed]\n\n&lt;!-- See notes at top of file about selecting a license. \nIf you choose CC0: This dataset is dedicated to the public domain for the benefit of scientific pursuits.

However, Hugging Face repos function a little differently from GitHub\u2019s, so we will review the details relevant to those differences and refer back to the GitHub directions where necessary.</p> <p>Firstly, when making changes it is still best not to work on the main branch, but instead go through the pull request (PR) process. This process is a bit different on Hugging Face, as this is not their focus. Instead of initializing a new branch, we initialize a new PR. There are two ways of doing this, but both rely on the UI (web interface). </p> <ol> <li> <p>Make your change directly on the UI (upload a file, edit the dataset/model card, etc), BUT select \u201cOpen as a pull request to the <code>main</code> branch\u201d and write a descriptive commit message of your changes before pressing <code>commit</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate to the \u201cCommunity\u201d tab, and click \u201cNew pull request\u201d</p> </li> </ol> Community tab with New pull request button New Pull Request Interface <p>Their instructions for \u201cfrom the website\u201d are out of date.</p> <p>You actually select \u201cAdd file\u201d, choose upload or create file, and you can upload any number of files (that are reasonable to include in a single commit) in a single commit, just select \u201cOpen as a pull request to the <code>main</code> branch\u201d, as described in #1.</p> <p>Now, to continue with the local branch method (if you intend to make multiple commits), give your PR an informative title and select \u201cCreate PR branch\u201d. This will take you to a new page with instructions on how to connect locally to the PR and send your updates back to the repo. If the repo is private, you will need to ensure your credentials are set before cloning/fetching.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you have made all of your changes, it is time to publish your branch. This is similar to initializing the PR on GitHub, in that you should:</p> <ul> <li>Provide a detailed description of what your PR does</li> <li>Tag one or two other people on the project to review it (<code>@hf-username please review</code>) From here, reviewers can add their comments and suggestions on your PR (Note: to see the files in the PR, click on the last commit, then select \u201cBrowse files\u201d)</li> </ul> <p>Now, if there are changes to be made based on reviewer suggestions, files can be edited as usual (pushing to the PR branch). Alternatively, if you are working from the web interface and need to add files (or edit files of a supported type), then click on \u201cfrom: refs/pr/#\u201d just below the title of your PR to view the copy of the repo on the PR branch (like looking at a different branch on GitHub).

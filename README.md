## Logos

We have two versions of the logo, a [fish](logos/Imageomics_logo_fish.png) and a [butterfly](logos/Imageomics_logo_butterfly.png), which should be used for scientific posters, conference, workshop, and meeting marketing materials, etc. Choice of logo is based on user preference.

## Templates

### Hugging Face
We have Imageomics-specific versions of Hugging Face's Dataset and Model Card templates with guidance and examples, along with some reference information for their flavor of markdown and the Imageomics grant information. 

To use the [template](templates) for a new dataset or model repository on HF, just navigate to the "Model/Dataset Card" tab on your repo, select "Create Model/Dataset Card", then copy and paste the contents of the appropriate template ([Dataset Card](templates/HF_DatasetCard_Template_Imageomics.md?plain=1) or [Model Card](templates/HF_ModelCard_Template_Imageomics.md?plain=1)) into the README.md file. For more information on working with Hugging Face, see the [HF Repo Guide](wiki-guide/3.2.-Hugging-Face-Repo-Guide.md) and [HF Workflow](wiki-guide/2.2.-The-Hugging-Face-Workflow.md) entries in the Imageomics Guide.

**Note:** The Dataset and Model cards have incorporated some of Hugging Face's January 2024 updates (following their [Dataset Card Overhaul](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/commit/6dd7ee829bd1b1216663a9993c1943c29b64690a)). It doesn't appear they will be updated more and we do not currently anticipate further large updates on our end as our overall template formats have diverged, but you may nevertheless wish to check HF for extra information or tagging updates ([HF Dataset Card](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/datasetcard_template.md), [HF Model Card](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md)).

### GitHub Projects
To help you get started working with [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects), we have an [Imageomics General Project Template](https://github.com/orgs/Imageomics/projects/31/views/1) with both a [Taskboard](https://github.com/orgs/Imageomics/projects/31/views/1) and [Table](https://github.com/orgs/Imageomics/projects/31/views/2) view initialized, along with label and milestone displays turned on. To learn more about working with GitHub Projects and how this might improve your project workflow, check out our [Guide to GitHub Projects](wiki-guide/4.1.-Guide-to-GitHub-Projects.md).

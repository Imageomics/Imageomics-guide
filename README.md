## About the Guide

This guide started as an Institute-internal wiki, focused on providing guidance and best practices for collaborative and interdisciplinary (computer science + biology) work. Recognizing that the topics and suggestions are broadly applicable to anyone working in similar or adjacent fields, we moved the vast majority to this [guide](https://imageomics.github.io/Collaborative-distributed-science-guide/). To increase accessibility for those less familiar with GitHub, we generated the web site from our Markdown documents (which used to be wiki pages) with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/Imageomics/Collaborative-distributed-science-guide/issues) with any questions regarding the content of this guide.

# Welcome to the Collaborative Distributed Science Guide!

This website hosts guides to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and reproducible workflows, documentation, and general best-practices for collaborative science. We aim to provide a helpful resource for scientists working in [_imageomics_](wiki-guide/Glossary-for-Imageomics.md/#imageomics) and related interdisciplinary fields.

For information about customizing this guide template, see [About the Guide](https://github.com/Imageomics/Collaborative-distributed-science-guide?tab=readme-ov-file#about-the-guide).

## Highlights

There are many pages of useful information contained in this guide covering a range of topics from project management and workflows, to repositories and archives, to a glossary of scientific terms for improved interdisciplinary communication.

### Just starting a project?

Check out our guides to get your project off on the right foot!

- [The GitHub Repo Guide](wiki-guide/GitHub-Repo-Guide.md): This page reviews expected and suggested GitHub repository contents, as well as structural considerations.

- [The Hugging Face Repo Guide](wiki-guide/Hugging-Face-Repo-Guide.md): Analogous expected and suggested repository contents for Hugging Face repositories; there are notable differences from GitHub in both content and structure.

- [FAIR Guide](wiki-guide/FAIR-Guide.md): Guide to producing FAIR digital products, from metadata collection through product documentation and publication. This builds on the content in both the GitHub and Hugging Face Repository Guides, providing checklists to ensure [code](wiki-guide/Code-Checklist.md), [data](wiki-guide/Data-Checklist.md), and [model](wiki-guide/Model-Checklist.md) repositories are FAIR. The latter two closely follow our [HF Templates](wiki-guide/About-Templates.md).

### Project repo up, what's next?

Check out our workflow guides for how to interact with your new repo:

- [The GitHub Workflow](wiki-guide/The-GitHub-Workflow.md): This page mainly focuses on branching and the PR process.

- [The Hugging Face Workflow](wiki-guide/The-Hugging-Face-Workflow.md): Analogous workflow directions for Hugging Face; there are notable differences from GitHub in how this process works practically, though the concept is the same.

### Project management or organization got you down?

Discover new tools to help:

- [Guide to GitHub Projects](wiki-guide/Guide-to-GitHub-Projects.md): This page focuses on GitHub's project management tool, Projects, which integrates issues and pull requests into a unified task board to keep tabs on how your project is progressing. Labels, milestones, and assignee tags provide improved organization, and allow for more focused views.

- [Helpful Tools for your Workflow](wiki-guide/Helpful-Tools-for-your-Workflow.md): Collection of useful tools to facilitate and improve workflows. Comments and recommendations encouraged!

- [Virtual Environments](wiki-guide/Virtual-Environments.md): Summary of `conda` and `pip` environments: how to make, use, and share them.

## Collaborative Infrastructure used by Imageomics and ABC

- GitHub
    - [Imageomics](https://github.com/Imageomics) and [ABC](https://github.com/ABC-Center) Code Repositories, where we store our code (software + tools).
    - GitHub's [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en)
        - [Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories)
        - [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects)
- Hugging Face
    - [Imageomics](https://huggingface.co/imageomics) and [ABC](https://hf.co/ABC-Center) Organization Pages, where we store our datasets and models (and their metadata).
    - Additionally, use [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces) to run demos of models and other projects.
    - Hugging Face's [Docs](https://huggingface.co/docs)
        - [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-the-hub)
        - [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-overview)

## Other pages of note

- [Glossary for Imageomics](wiki-guide/Glossary-for-Imageomics.md): Collection of terms used in imageomics. The goal is to ensure all participating domains are represented, thus facilitating interdisciplinary communication. This is a group effort, please check it out and add terms you think should be there!
- [Command Line Cheat Sheet](wiki-guide/Command-Line-Cheat-Sheet.md): Collection of useful bash and git commands with some git tips.

# Dataset Card Checklist
Below is a checklist encompassing all sections of a dataset card. Review notes and guidance provided in the full [datatset card template](HF_DatasetCard_Template_mkdocs.md/) for more details.

!!! tip "Pro tip" 

    Use the eye icon at the top of this page to access the source and copy the markdown for the checklist above into an issue on your GitHub [Repo](GitHub-Repo-Guide.md) or [Project](Guide-to-GitHub-Projects.md) so you can check the boxes as you add each element to your [dataset card](HF_DatasetCard_Template_mkdocs.md).

## General Information

- [ ] **License**: Verify and specify the license type (e.g., `cc0-1.0`).
- [ ] **Language**: Indicate the language(s) (e.g., `en`).
- [ ] **Pretty Name**: Provide a descriptive name for the dataset.
- [ ] **Task Categories**: List relevant task categories (e.g., image-classification). Refer to [task categories](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface.js/blob/main/packages/tasks/src/pipelines.ts).
- [ ] **Tags**: Include relevant tags (e.g., `biology`, `image`, `animals`, `CV`).
- [ ] **Size Categories**: Specify dataset size (e.g., `n<1K`, `1K<n<10K`, etc.).

## Dataset Details

- [ ] **Curated by**: List curators or authors.
- [ ] **Language(s) (NLP)**: Specify if applicable.
- [ ] **Homepage**: Provide a link to the homepage (if you have a website set up, not required).
- [ ] **Repository**: Link to related GitHub repository.
- [ ] **Paper**: Link to related research paper (not expected at this point).
- [ ] **Description**: Provide a summary of what the dataset is used for.
- [ ] **Supported Tasks and Leaderboards**: List any relevant tasks and leaderboards, e.g., benchmarking results.

---

## Dataset Structure

- [ ] **Data Format**: Describe the structure of the dataset. See guidance on formatting in the [full dataset card template](HF_DatasetCard_Template_mkdocs.md/#__codelineno-0-71).
- [ ] **Data Instances**: Describe data files.
Ex: All images are named `<img_id>.png`, each within a folder named for the species. They are 1024 x 1024, and the color has been standardized using `<link to color standardization package>`.
- [ ] **Data Fields**: Describe the types of the data files or the columns in a CSV with metadata ([example](HF_DatasetCard_Template_mkdocs.md/#__codelineno-0-114)).
- [ ] **Data Splits**: Describe any splits (e.g., train, test, validation).

---

## Dataset Creation
Refer to examples and explanations provided in the full [dataset card template](HF_DatasetCard_Template_mkdocs.md/#__codelineno-0-129).

- [ ] **Curation Rationale**: Explain why this dataset was created.
- [ ] **Source Data**: Describe the source data.
    - [ ] **Data Collection and Processing**: Describe data creation, selection, filtering, normalization, and tools used.
    - [ ] **Source Data Producers**: List original data producers or sources.
- [ ] **Annotations**: Include details on annotations.
    - [ ] **Annotation Process**: Describe the process and tools used.
    - [ ] **Annotators**: List the annotators if applicable.
- [ ] **Personal and Sensitive Information**: Indicate any sensitive information in the dataset.

## Considerations for Using the Data
Things to consider while working with the dataset. For instance, maybe there are hybrids and they are labeled in the `hybrid_stat` column, so to get a subset without hybrids, subset to all instances in the metadata file such that `hybrid_stat` is _not_ "hybrid".

- [ ] **Bias, Risks, and Limitations**: Describe any known issues with the dataset. For instance, if your data exhibits a long-tailed distribution (and why). 
- [ ] **Recommendations**: Provide recommendations for using the dataset responsibly.

---

## Licensing Information
See discussion and references in the [template](HF_DatasetCard_Template_mkdocs.md/#__codelineno-0-19), also remember the [digital product release and licensing policy](Digital-products-release-licensing-policy.md/).

- [ ] **Licensing Details**: Confirm and list all licensing details.

---

## Citation

- [ ] **Data Citation**: Provide a BibTeX citation for the dataset.
- [ ] **Associated Paper Citation**: Provide a BibTeX citation for any associated papers.

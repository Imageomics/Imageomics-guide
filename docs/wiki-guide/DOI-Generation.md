# DOI Generation

This guide discusses DOI generation for digital artifacts that may be associated with publications, such as datasets, models, and software.
You are likely familiar with DOIs from citing (journal/arXiv/conference) papers, for which they are generated by the publisher and regularly used in citations. However, they are also invaluable for proper citation of code, models, and data. Similar to how DOIs help track different versions of preprints on repositories like arXiv, they can provide persistent identification and versioning for your research artifacts beyond traditional publications.

## What is a DOI?

A DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a _persistent_ (permanent) digital identifier for any object (data, model, code, etc.) that _uniquely_ distinguishes it from other objects and links to information&mdash;metadata&mdash;about the object. The International DOI Foundation (IDF) is responsible for developing and administering the DOI system. See their [What is a DOI?](https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/) article for more information.

## How do you generate a DOI?

When publishing code, data, or models, there are various options for DOI generation, and selecting one is generally dependent on where the object of interest is published. We will go over the two standard methods used by the Institute here, and we mention a third option for completeness. A comparison of these three options is provided in the [Data Archive Options Comparative Overview](../pdfs/Data_Archive-Publication-Options-Comparative-Overview.pdf).

### 1. Generate a DOI on Hugging Face

This is the simplest method for generating a DOI for a model or dataset since [Hugging Face partnered with DataCite to offer this option](https://huggingface.co/blog/introducing-doi).

!!! warning "Warning"
    Though it is a very simple process, it is not one to be taken lightly, as there is no removing data once this has been done--any changes require generation of a _**new**_ DOI for the updated version: the old version will be maintained in perpetuity!

!!! warning "Warning"
    As stated in the [Imageomics Digital Products Release and Licensing Policy](Digital-products-release-licensing-policy.md), DOIs are not to be generated for Imageomics Organization Repositories until approval has been granted by the Senior Data Scientist or Institute Leadership.

Hugging Face allows for the generation of a DOI through the settings tab on the Model or Dataset. For details on _how_ to generate a DOI with Hugging Face, please see the [Hugging Face DOI Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/doi).

### 2. Generate a DOI with Zenodo

This is the most common method used for generating a DOI for a GitHub repository, because [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) has a [GitHub integration](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/), which is accessed through your Zenodo account settings (for more information, please see [GitHub's associated Docs](https://docs.github.com/articles/referencing-and-citing-content)). Zenodo can also be used to generate DOIs for data, as is relatively common in biology. However, for direct use of ML models and datasets, there are many more advantages to using Hugging Face; please see the [Data Archive Options Comparative Overview](../pdfs/Data_Archive-Publication-Options-Comparative-Overview.pdf) for more information.[^1]
[^1]: The [Data Archive Options Comparative Overview](../pdfs/Data_Archive-Publication-Options-Comparative-Overview.pdf) was created in May 2023 when we were deciding Institute archive recommendations, so it does not include information about newer features such as [Hugging Face's dataset viewer](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/datasets-viewer), which greatly simplifies previewing datasets for downstream users.

#### Automatic Generation

When your GitHub and Zenodo accounts are linked, there will be a list of available repositories under the GitHub tab in settings on Zenodo. All those that are enabled are grouped at the top (just below the instructions). If the switch is on to enable a repository, then your next GitHub release will trigger the generation of a repository snapshot with a new or updated DOI. Click on the DOI badge next to the repository to get the code to add the badge to your repository README. Clicking on the repository name will take you to information about that repository's releases.

![Zenodo instructions and enabled repos](images/doi-generation/enabled_repos+intstructions.png){ loading=lazy, width="800" }

!!! info "The Sync now button"
    There is a "Sync now" button at the top right of the instructions, with information on when the last sync occurred. Observe that a badge appears for the enabled repository that **_has_** a DOI, while the one without just shows up as enabled; this will also be true for repositories to which you have access but that you did not submit to Zenodo yourself.

#### Metadata Tracking

When automatically generating a DOI with Zenodo, it uses information provided in your `CITATION.cff` file to populate the metadata for the record. However, there is important information that is not supported through this integration despite its inclusion in the `CITATION.cff` format in some cases.

If your repository is likely to be updated repeatedly (i.e., generating new releases), then you may consider adding a `.zenodo.json` to preserve the remaining metadata on release sync with Zenodo for DOI. This metadata includes grant (funding) information, references (which may be included in your `CITATION.cff`), associated paper(s), and a description of your repository/code. Details and a sample file structure are provided in the [Zenodo Metadata section](GitHub-Repo-Guide.md#zenodo-metadata) of the GitHub Repo Guide.

_Alternatively_, this information can be updated manually on the Zenodo page for the DOI record. When logged in to Zenodo, a large orange "Edit" button will appear in the top right (as in the image below). There is the ability to save as you go (without publishing the metadata changes) and an additional option to share a link with collaborators to view the suggested record information.

/// caption
///

!!! note "Note"
    Each collaborator who should have access to the Zenodo record must be manually granted access through their Zenodo account. This can be done by clicking on the "Share" button and selecting "Add people" at the pop-up screen.

    It is ***highly*** recommended that at least one other person on a project has access at the "manage" level.

#### Manual Generation

Building on the alternate edit options, there is also the option to simply generate one or all of your releases through a direct upload to Zenodo's site. Automatic generation through the GitHub integration is the recommended approach since it will generate an updated DOI on each release and create easier connections.

!!! warning
    Do **not** mix the two methods. One must start with the GitHub integration, otherwise two separate records will be created. If a repo already has releases prior to turning on the GitHub integration, one can contact Zenodo to have them import the earlier releases as well. This is also another motivator for setting up the [requisite files in a GitHub repo](GitHub-Repo-Guide.md#zenodo-metadata) before the first release.

#### Access Management

When creating a new record on Zenodo, please ensure that other members of your project have access, as appropriate. In particular, there should be at least one member of Institute leadership or the Senior Data Scientist added to the record with management permissions. This ensures the ability to maintain the metadata and address matters related to the record (which may extend beyond your tenure with the Institute) in a timely manner.

#### Add a Zenodo DOI Badge

Congratulations, your repository has been archived on Zenodo! Now, how do you get the nice badge to display on your GitHub `README` so everyone knows it has been archived?

1. Navigate to your account settings and select "GitHub" (see earlier screenshot at [automatic generation](#automatic-generation) for what the page looks like).

2. Find the repo that has just been updated in the "Enabled Repositories" list (we'll use this guide's repo for the example), and click on the badge next to the repo's name:

    ![Screenshot of GitHub Integration enabled repos with their DOI badges next to their names, the DOI badge next to the collaborative distributed science guide is circled](images/doi-generation/enabled_repos_badges.png)

    The pop up will look something like this:

    ![Screenshot of Zenodo DOI badge rendering options, only Markdown version fully shown: '[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1038590952.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17210328)'](images/doi-generation/badge-markdown.png)

3. Copy the Markdown text and paste it next to your `README` title. Note that the DOI URL should be the _version agnostic_ DOI (this is the one you will add to your `CITATION.cff`, as noted in the [GitHub Repo Guide](GitHub-Repo-Guide.md#citation))

    ![Screenshot of collaborative distributed science guide repo README file header in the GitHub UI with the badge text from above next to the title](images/doi-generation/README-badge-paste.png)

This only has to be done once; using the version agnostic DOI with the general SVG means the badge will be updated to always display the DOI of the latest release and it will link to that Zenodo record.

!!! warning
    If you use the badge from the Zenodo page itself, it will be specific for _that_ version, so be sure to get the version agnostic one.

### 3. Generate a DOI with Dryad

[Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/about) is another research data repository, similar to Zenodo, through which one can archive digital objects (such as, but not limited to, data) supporting scholarly publications, and obtain a DOI. It has a review process when depositing data and requires dedication to the public domain (CC0) of all digital objects uploaded. Imageomics through OSU is a member organization of Dryad, reducing or eliminating data deposit charge(s). To determine whether Dryad is a suitable archive for Institute data products supporting your publication, please consider the [Data Archive Options Comparative Overview](../pdfs/Data_Archive-Publication-Options-Comparative-Overview.pdf) for more information, and consult with the Institute's Senior Data Scientist.[^1]

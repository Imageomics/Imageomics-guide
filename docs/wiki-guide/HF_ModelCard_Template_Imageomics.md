NOTE: Add more tags (your particular animal, type of model and use-case, etc.).

As with your GitHub Project repo, it is important to choose an appropriate license for your model. Alongside the appropriate stakeholders (eg., your PI, co-authors), select a license that is [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) (OSI) compliant. You may also wish to consider adding a [RAIL license](https://www.licenses.ai/ai-licenses), which addresses responsible use.
For more information on how to choose a license and why it matters, see [Choose A License](https://choosealicense.com) and [A Quick Guide to Software Licensing for the Scientist-Programmer](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002598) by A. Morin, et al.
See the [Imageomics policy for licensing](https://imageomics.github.io/Imageomics-guide/wiki-guide/Digital-products-release-licensing-policy/) for more information.

License tags (for the `yaml` above) can be found [here](https://hf.co/docs/hub/repositories-licenses).

Fill in as much information as you can at each location that says "More information needed".

# Model Card for [Model Name]

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. 

This model card aims to be a base template for new models. It has been generated using [this raw template](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md?plain=1), and further altered to suit Imageomics Institute needs. -->

## Model Details

# _"Why should I put my work into the GitHub org,"_ you ask?

The [Imageomics GitHub organization](https://github.com/Imageomics) exists to facilitate collaboration and version control among team members working on projects within the institute and make them available to the research community. You are encouraged to take advantage of the benefits of using this GitHub organization for your institute projects!

## Centralization 

This is the main aspect that leads to other benefits. Whether you are running your code on your own computer, a GPU server, a supercomputing cluster, AWS, or the Matrix, maintaining a git repository of this code hosted on the institute GitHub org keeps everyone's work that is otherwise scattered around in a single place.  Some of the benefits derived from this are ...

### Collaboration

- You know where your team's work is, and your team knows where your work is. 
- Code is simpler to find, share, access, review, and manage.
- Access privileges can be granted and managed through [teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams), rather than access having to be managed on a per-individual basis.
- Progress can be communicated readily, and help can be solicited when needed, including through [teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams).

### Knowledge Sharing

- Projects documented by a well-written README file are much more accessible than combing through old Zoom recordings to find out or remember what someone else is working on. 
- When new members join, they can get up-to-speed quickly. 
- When members move on to new roles, their work is preserved and more easily continued and built upon. 
- Good practices can diffuse through and between teams more quickly. 
- These points enhance the research capacity and productivity of individuals as well as the overall institute.

### Visibility + Impact

- Work hosted under the Imageomics GitHub organization is directly associated with and contributes to the institute's brand, showcasing the collective contributions of our teams and enhancing the visibility and impact of their work within the broader community. 
- Your profile is featured alongside repositories you contribute to, providing opportunities for networking with those who find your work valuable.


## Professional Development

Despite its rough edges, the common standard for version control and code management is git. You'll get a competitive edge with experience using it on a team to collaborate.

## Showcasing Your Work

If you want your public work with Imageomics featured on your personal GitHub profile, you can make use of the GitHub [pin](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile) feature to have public repositories of your choice appear at the top of your profile whether they belong to you through an organization or personally.

## Flexibility

While we encourage you to host your institute-related work on the Imageomics GitHub organization to maximize these benefits, we understand that there may be situations where other platforms or private repositories are more appropriate. These include:

- Personal projects or work not directly tied to the institute.
- Projects developed prior to joining the institute where transferring ownership might be complex or undesirable.

We strongly encourage you to keep your institute-related work centrally organized in the [Imageomics GitHub organization](https://github.com/Imageomics) to maximize the benefits for you and your fellow researchers!

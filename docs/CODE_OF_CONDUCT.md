# Imageomics Institute Principles of Engagement

As members of the Imageomics community, we agree to maintain an environment where every participant feels welcome to be their true self and speak from the heart.

To this end, we agree as individuals and as a group to:

- **Listen to understand.** When one person talks, others listen.

- **Speak to be understood.** We use lay terms and are patient with people who are not experts in our specific field. We are all learning, no matter who we are.

- Embrace **“Yes and…”** Focus on possibilities instead of obstacles. Be inclusive of other people’s ideas. Honor divergence. 

- **Take space / make space.** Those who tend to talk a lot are intentional about letting others talk first, while those who tend to hold back are intentional about contributing.

- **Beware of blind spots.** We do not know what we do not know. We are vigilant for differences among our experiences and positions. 

- **Respect time.** When a session is over, we need to move on. There is designated time for in-depth follow up and continuing conversations. 

- **Care** for each other. We bring our full selves to the community, and we look out for each other wholeheartedly. 

We abide by these principles in all Imageomics spaces, including but not limited to digital and in-person meetings, formal and informal gatherings, online discussion forums and chat spaces, and field and lab work. 

Discrimination, bullying or harassment–sexual or otherwise–is misconduct. Those found to engage in misconduct will be subject to dismissal from the project and further actions as directed by the guidelines of the employers and the place of incidence.

If you believe you have experienced or witnessed misconduct in an Imageomics setting, please take these steps:

1. Document the incident;

2. Tell someone you trust;

3. Report the incident to Diane Boghrat.

Privacy will be protected to the greatest extent possible.

### VALUES
#### TRANSPARENCY
We ensure our efforts are clear about assumptions, uncertainty, and limits, and provide open sources of information, processes, and discovery.
#### ACCOUNTABILITY
We are responsible, individually and collectively, for the outcomes we produce and ensure, to the best of our abilities, that the methods outcome matches intended use.
#### INCLUSION & COLLABORATION
We create and nurture inclusive environments and welcome, value, and affirm all members of our community. We also consider how and for whom solutions are created and promote the diversification of perspectives in the creation process. We actively engage others’ perspectives, recognize everyone’s potential to contribute new ideas, and work together to find creative solutions to complex problems.
#### SAFETY
We ensure our practices are ethical and unbiased to the best of our ability. We address biases when we discover it and practice good data governance.  We work to improve practices and dismantle existing structures that create harm to people or the environment.
